# My First App

Welcome to the repository for my first ever application! This project has been a labor of love for two months and has been a journey of countless trials and errors. While there are still many imperfections as this is my initial attempt, I aim to further develop and stabilize it as I use this app as a stepping stone for future projects!

## Differentiation

- **A variety of chart displays**: In addition to the usual pie charts found in existing budget apps, this app also includes a wide range of charts such as trends in expenditure by category and changes in assets.
- **Easy operation**: I designed a user-friendly UI where all tasks can be performed from the home screen with just a few simple gestures, eliminating the need for unnecessary settings screens.
- **HeatMap**: This feature will help you identify what times of the day your spending usually occurs. You might discover interesting patterns like overspending before bedtime!

## Features

1. **Goal setting and schedule prediction**: Set your financial goals and the app will help you predict a schedule to achieve them.
2. **Budget management**: Set a budget and manage it with ease.
3. **Transaction detail entry**: Enter transaction details with a simple interface.
4. **Calendar overview**: Easily check transactions at a glance on the calendar screen.
5. **Chart variety**: Use various charts to help gain a meta-awareness of your financial habits.
